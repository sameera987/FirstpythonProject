# Triangle classifier
# write a program that classifies  a triangle based on its side lengths
# Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides, determine if the triangle is equilateral
# (all sides are equal), isosceles (exactly two sides are equal) or scalene (No sides are equal)
# use an if else statement to classify the triangle.
